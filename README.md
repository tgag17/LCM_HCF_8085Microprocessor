# LCM_HCF_8085Microprocessor

The repository contains the Assembly Language Programs to compute the LCM and HCF of n 8-bit integers.
The programs are written in GNUSimulator

`hcf_2` : Computes HCF of 2 numbers using the recursive method <br>
`hcf_3` : Computes HCF of 3 numbers using the recursive method <br>
`lcm_2` : Computes LCM of 2 numbers by computing the multiples of one of the numbers. <br>
`lcm_3` : Computes LCM of 3 numbers by computing the multiples of one of the numbers. <br>
`lcm_using_hcf` : Computes the HCF of two numbers using the Product/HCF formula
